# Task-3 
** Objective:
I designed an interactive Sales Dashboard using Power BI, based on a sales financial dataset from Kaggle. This dashboard helps stakeholders analyze business performance through key metrics like Sales, Profit, and Growth across different regions, categories, and time periods.

** Steps I Followed:

** Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and ensured date formats and number formats were consistent using Power BI Power Query.

** Selected KPIs:

Total Sales

Total Profit

Profit Margin (%)

YoY Growth

** Dashboard Design Elements:

Cards to show total KPIs (Sales, Profit, Orders)

Line charts for time-series analysis (monthly/quarterly trends)

Bar/Column charts to compare regions and categories

Slicers/Filters for Region, Category, Date, and Segment

Consistent color theme and fonts

Navigation menu using bookmarks/buttons

** Interactivity:

Stakeholders can filter views by region, year, or category

Charts update dynamically based on slicer selections

** Outcome:
Helped visualize key business insights and supported decision-making by identifying top-performing areas and growth opportunities.
